### What makes this theme different?
There are so many dark themes out there, but they all have issues, such as:

 - Not dark enough
 - So dark that elements become invisible
 - Lack of contrast between tabs

All of these issues caused eye strain and decreased my productivity, so I decided to create my own!

### Features

 - Suitable for both bright and dim environments
 - Easy to distinguish between active and inactive tabs
 - Gentle on the eyes, with proper contrast between elements
 - Available in three flavours: Charcoal, Charcoal Grey, and Charcoal Black

### Installation

1. Go to "Releases"
2. Download the `.crx` file
3. Open Chrome > Click the extensions icon > Enable "Developer mode"
4. Drag and drop the theme file
5. Click "Add theme"
