### What makes this theme different?
There are so many dark themes for but all of them have issues like

 - Not dark enough?
 - Too dark that every element is invisible!
 - Lack of contrast between tabs.

All of these caused eye strain & decreased my productivity. 
So I decided to make one myself!


### Features

 - Suitable for both Bright & Dim environments.
 - Easily differentiate between Active & Inactive tabs.
 - Easy on eyes with proper contrast between elements.
 - Three flavours: Charcoal, Charcoal Grey & Charcoal Black
